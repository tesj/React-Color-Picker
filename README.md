# React Color Picker
I built color picker React app as a kind of intro to React. I initially had just the input boxes to set the RGB values, but I decided that color sliders would be a great addition for UX. <br/><br/>
At this point, design isn't my greatest strength. I can make it functional and look neat, but I am in no way a graphics designer. I may come back to this in the future and redesign it. <br/><br/>
## Running the App
1. Install Node.js if it is not already (https://nodejs.org) <br/>
2. Clone or download this repository and open it in your IDE of choice (I use VS Code) <br/>
3. Use the terminal to run ```npm install``` to install all necessary packages <br/>
4. Run ```npm run dev``` to start the app <br/>
5. Open the app in the browser by using the following link or the one provided in the terminal: ```http://localhost:5173```. <br/><br/>
