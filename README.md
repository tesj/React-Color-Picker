# React-Color-Picker
I built color picker React app as a kind of intro to React. I initially had just the input boxes to set the RGB values, but I decided that color sliders would be a great addition for UX. <br/><br/>
At this point, UI isn't my strongest point. I can make it functional and look neat, but I am in no way a graphics designer. I may come back to this in the future and redesign it. <br/><br/>
To run this app, make sure you have Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org). Clone or download this repository, open it in your IDE of choice (I used VS Code), and use the terminal to run ```npm install``` to install all necessary packages. After the packages have been installed, run ```npm run dev``` in the terminal to start the app. You can then open the app in the browser by using the following link or the one provided in the terminal: ```http://localhost:5173```. <br/><br/>
